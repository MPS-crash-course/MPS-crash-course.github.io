# The Heisenberg Antiferromagnet

To guide our discussion of Matrix Product States (MPS) we will keep in mind a particular task: namely computing the dynamical structure factor for the Heisenberg Antiferromagnet. This task will combine all aspects of MPS that we will cover in this course. Let us start by introducing the model, provide some experimental motivation for this task, and then provide the details of the calculation we want to perform.
